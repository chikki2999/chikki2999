## 🧠 About me 

Fourth-year BTech CSE student @KIIT. Aspiring Data Analyst with hands-on experience on both sides of the table - started as a GTM Growth Executive at Antbox , then moved into Marketing Operations at Qapita where I spent months deep in the data. I've seen how business teams think and what they need, but I'm more drawn to the technical side - the problem-solving, the logic, the actual building. Data Analyst is the sweet spot for me: technical enough to dig into the code and datasets, but still connected to real business problems. I enjoy finding patterns in chaos, optimizing processes with data, and turning raw numbers into insights that actually matter. Curious by nature—always learning, building, and experimenting across tech, sports, art, and food.
