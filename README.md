##  🧠 About me 

Fourth-year BTech CSE student @KIIT. Aspiring Data Analyst with hands-on experience on both sides of the table - started as a GTM Growth Executive at Antbox , then moved into Marketing Operations at Qapita where I spent months deep in the data. I've seen how business teams think and what they need, but I'm more drawn to the technical side - the problem-solving, the logic, the actual building. Data Analyst is the sweet spot for me: technical enough to dig into the code and datasets, but still connected to real business problems. I enjoy finding patterns in chaos, optimizing processes with data, and turning raw numbers into insights that actually matter. Curious by nature - always learning, building, and experimenting.
